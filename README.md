### What is this ?
As more and more businesses use five-star reviews as a method to stimulate buyers' interest in purchasing products, rather than providing an accurate reflection of the goods, there has been an increase in fake reviews without text or pictures, resulting from rewards offered by businesses.Therefor I built a project to filter those fake comments.
### How to use ?
You can input the names of the stores in the terminal of crawler.py separated by a space, and the script will output the real ratings and the credibility of the reviews, providing accurate and trustworthy information about each store.
